# Music Player
This is a simple Electron app designed to be a music player. Right now, the only things that work are the play/pause, import, and close buttons. The window is draggable by the way.
I am currently working on making the other buttons work and adding some other features, but I wanted to put this prototype out there.

### Please Note:
This app was made by modifying [Nasha Wanich's Electron App Template](https://github.com/nasha-wanich/electron-app-template) to make it into a music player.
