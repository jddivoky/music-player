## Version 0.1.1 (Beta 1.1)
Bare-bones version of the media player; simply for showing what I'm currently working on.
|Button/Feature|Functioning?|
|---|---|
|Close|Yes, of course!|
|Minimize|Sadly, no 😔|
|Go back a song|Also no|
|Play/Pause|Yes!|
|Skip song|Somehow, no|
|Import|Well, duh|

Beta 1.1 adds the app icon, and both start menu and desktop shortcuts! <br>

# Music Player
This is a simple Electron app designed to be a music player. Right now, the only things that work are the play/pause, import, and close buttons. The window is draggable by the way.
I am currently working on making the other buttons work and adding some other features, but I wanted to put this prototype out there.

### Please Note:
This app was made by modifying [Nasha Wanich's Electron App Template](https://github.com/nasha-wanich/electron-app-template) to make it into a music player.
